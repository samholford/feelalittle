## Feel A Little

#### By A Little Ink and Evie Kemp

Feel A Little is a joint passion project between artist and children's poet Jenny Palmer aka A Little Ink, and designer Evie Kemp. Both grown-up over-feelers, we felt that kids need more outlets to both express and understand emotions - they're complicated beasts! 

Through interaction and discussion we explore a new feeling each week, culminating in an illustrated poem inspired by the contributions we receive.
